Secure universal authentication system

== Description ==
A convenient, privacy-first, and secure authentication system with built-in 2fa. One account allows users to sign up or sign in to your website with just a single click. One account - passwordless, secure, and convenient way to sign in/up on any website.

Major features in One account include:

* One-click sign-up.
    * One account “auto-fills” data when users sign up making sign-ups frictionless. Convert your 6 inputs form into one button sign-up.
* Not linked to social services.
* No fake accounts or bots.
* No need for RE/CAPTCHA
* Acquire elderly/non-tech-savvy users
    * It is difficult for non-tech-savvy especially for elderly people to create accounts and keep them safe. With One account it’s all taken care of! users just need to press a button for confirmation.
* 2FA built-in.
    * Take advantage of built-in 2FA with One account (multi-factor authentication is planned for the near future). The best part is that not you nor your users have to do anything to enable it.
* No maintenance needed.
    * You don’t need to worry about your users’ accounts being compromised or handling password resets. We make sure they are safe and happy.
* User data verifications.
* Simple integration.
